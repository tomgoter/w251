In the time allowed, how many images did you annotate?
Home many instances of the Millennium Falcon did you annotate? How many TIE Fighters?
Based on this experience, how would you handle the annotation of large image data set?
Think about image augmentation? How would augmentations such as flip, rotation, scale, cropping, and translation effect the annotations?
